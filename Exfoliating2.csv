23,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,150,18.60,"This toner left my face feeling tight and dry. I've reverted to Mizon's aha toner, and my skin feels much better!",3
24,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,150,18.60,It’s a waste of money. I didn’t see any results after six months.,3
25,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,150,18.60,Item came damaged. The box and cap were both open and the toner leaked all over.,3
26,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,150,18.60,Not sure if I super love it. I have sensitive skin so I was worried about any bumps or breakouts. So far my face seems ok. Not sure if I glow or anything wow.,3

29,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I understand why this product receives 5 star reviews. I am in my 60's & use it every day.

31,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I really like this stuff. Easy to use. My only complaint is how sticky and tacky my hands feel after I put it on. But it's a minor inconvenience because the results are so good.,5
32,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I only used this once and seen a difference. I’m trying the travel size rn but I think Ima get the real deal once I finish this one. And it doesn’t dry out your skin at all! Great for oily skin type like mine,4
33,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,It made my skin very dry and didn't see any difference on my skin and I've used it daily for weeks. I'm glad I didn't purchase a bigger bottle.,1
34,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,"This definitely helps with the black heads on my nose, doesn't smell terrible, and it's pretty affordable.",5
35,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,The bottle on this is so thick and rigid that it’s hard to press to calibrate the amount you want to use. I end up wasting a lot of it. Won’t use again.,3
36,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,Beware! What I received was not the real stuff. The bottle and consistency are different.,1
37,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I have been using this product for years. Makes pores look smaller and clears up majority of blackheads. Just pat it into your skin!,5
38,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,"I’ve used this product for a couple of years, have purchased from PC website and amazon, and have never noticed any smell until this purchase. This one smells different than my previous bottles. Haven’t noticed any reaction - although I only use it twice a week- but think it’s a bit odd.",4
39,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,This makes my skin feel so good and definitely clears out my pores. The only downside for me personally is that it has a kind of sickly sweet smell for the first 2-3 mins you have it on but it quickly goes away.,5
40,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,"This claims to be a chemical exfoliating toner. I bought the trial size and used all of it. Never worked for me. This is supposed to be one of the top rated, and it's not worth the money. Pixi Glow Tonic from Target is better and cheaper",2
41,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I recieved a sample at sephora an loved it. This 1 had a weird smell to it. Not sure why.. it came sealed though an wasnt expired so don't know why it smells and the sephora 1 didnt,3
42,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,"I heard really good things about this brand, which is why I was extremely disappointed seeing that my item arrived broken. It had leaked all all over the bottle and a good amount is missing.",3

44,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I used to often have break-outs on the lower part of my face. Miraculously I seem to have less of these after using this Paula’s Choice. It also helped shrink the pores and fine lines on my face! I am not as conscious of my face now that the wrinkles and blackheads are not as apparent now,5
45,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,Only reason I give this product a low score is because this is NOT a good product for acne or acne prone skin. Do not buy if you have problematic skin such as myself.,2
46,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,It makes the skin smooth but it takes time,4
47,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,Well I have to travel 25 min away to return a half empty bottle that was delivered to me damaged??? ZERO STARS,1
48,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,Love this product. This is my third bottle and it has completely transformed my skin. No more texture or pores. No strong odor to it either. Bottle lasts about 3 months with everyday use,5
49,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,"I have not given this product time to see results. Not sure if I can use this due to the horrible odor of the product. The expiration date is 2026, but oh my gosh, it smells rotten!!!",3
50,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I use this any time I start to get a break out it really helps.,4
51,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,Smells just like latex paint and smells very strongly. Huge turnoff for this product. Used for about 2 weeks and saw no noticeable difference but definitely couldn’t stand the smell.,1
52,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,This is one of my favorite products ever! I love everything about it! Great price!,5
53,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,it works really well if you stay consistent BUT THE PRICE?? but its 100% worth it maybe not the small bottle like i got but yk pop off,4
54,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,I think this works well but it’s a little expensive so I got this small one. I don’t really like the smell.,4
55,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,118,35.00,"Works pretty well but haven't seen any major changes in pores, but it doesnt dry your skin out.",4
56,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,I bought this for the reviews and the impact on pore reduction. I use it to help with excessive sweating under my arms and I’ve noticed a big difference after 2 weeks.,5
57,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"I've been using Thayers toner for probably a decade now, and lavender was always my favorite. Not anymore. I love this toner so much I will probably never use anything else. Thank you, Thayers. Please never stop making this stuff.",5
58,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,I had very large pores I started using this product and my pores are almost gone I don’t even wear make up any more my skin is glowing,5

60,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"A friend told me she always uses toner and it's good for your skin so I got this to try. I don't know, I haven't really noticed a difference with this product, but it also didn't do anything bad to my skin either. It smells ok and feels ok. I'll keep using it and see if it just needs more time.",4
61,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,Thayer’s 2% AHA toner is high quality. Fragrance free and is easy to use by squeezing a little onto a cotton ball. Contains effective ingredients such as glycolic and lactic acids with witch hazel. 12 oz bottle.,4
62,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"I have been using this toner 1-2 times per day on a slightly regular basis. I think it really helps with exfoliating my dry, dead skin on my face. I definitely feel like my complexion is brighter and smoother. I like the scent and the bottle will last me a long time. I don't think you can go wrong with this brand.",5
63,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"If this was the original witch hazel I'd rate it 5 stars because I really love the original and how it feels/works. So if you're looking for a great, refreshing, pore toner then this brand in general is great. The issue here for me is that it is advertised as being a glycolic acid product, which I have used before, and was expecting to have similar results with this product. Let's just say the amount in here must be little to basically none because it hasn't given any results even slightly exfoliating or brightening or whatever. It feels and acts exactly like the regular witch hazel formula. I feel like it's false advertising and if I would have known that I wouldn't have ordered it. I would have ordered a glycolic acid product that actually works, and a bottle of the regular witch hazel separately. Pretty irritating, really. The scent is nice at least. So if you're looking for some actual results, I wouldn't recommend this product.",3
64,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"I have been using this for a few weeks in conjunction with my other face care regimen & so far have noticed a difference in the size of my pores. I love the smell. Nice size bottle, it has been hard to find this in the stores so when I need more will order.",5
65,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"I like Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid. It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft and clean feeling,",4
66,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"The toner didn't have any noticeable scent. It had a open top spout which allows you to use a a cotton pad/round. Personally, I like my toners in spray bottles so I can spray it while I am working to refresh my face. The toner is refreshing and feels nice during a hot summer day when I leave the bottle in the fridge.",4
67,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",355,14.99,"This toner does a good job of deep cleaning. It has a pleasant scent. It's a little over drying, but not too bad. It's gentle on my sensitive skin. I really like it.",4

73,"Glycolic Acid 7% Toner, Glycolic Sour 7% Toning Resurfacing Solution for Blemishes and Acne, Facial Exfoliation Astringe Pores",100,8.99,it doesn't work don't waste your money on it . instead just spend the extra few bucks on the ordinary one,2
74,"Glycolic Acid 7% Toner, Glycolic Sour 7% Toning Resurfacing Solution for Blemishes and Acne, Facial Exfoliation Astringe Pores",100,8.99,I thought it was ordinary glycolic acid and bought it. I should have checked the brand before buying it. Definitely returning it.,2
