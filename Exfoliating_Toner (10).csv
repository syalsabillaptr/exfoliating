"1","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Nothing special… it seems to work. I have sensitive skin and so far so good.","3"
"2","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I keep this in a fridge so it’s really nice and refreshing when used. Soothing in fact. I have acne and combination sensitive skin. This doesn’t make my skin burn/irritated. I’m not really expecting this product “alone” to clear my acne as it contains a really small amount of Aha&Bha in it. Overall, this is a good toner.","4"
"3","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Really not sure if this does a lot - no scent which is good","3"
"4","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I love this product. It actually changed my skin from acne prone to smooth and clear. It also decreased my pores and helped me with black heads and white heads. Love this product and definitely gonna buy it again.","5"
"5","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","The bottle was not sealed in any way … hence not very sure of the content","2"
"6","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","This toner left my face feeling tight and dry","3"
"7","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","For starters i have super dry dehydrated sensitive eczema prone skin. Literally quadruple homicide. My skin always looks so dead and dull and I have many dark marks and some texture so i legit hate my bare face and try to cover it with makeup. Physical exfoliants are too aggressive to slosh off the dead skin cells too. I’ve literally used this for two nights in a row and my pores legit disappeared. I can’t find them and my face is so smooth already. I haven’t had an irritation or purging yet but i like how light it is bc i was scared to venture into the aha bha area but after research information a lot my skin concerns were a good candidate for a chemical exfoliant. I only use it at night, i let my face dry completely before spraying a light layer then i let that sit and go do something else for like 20mins while it sits. I read on multiple skincare forums that this is the most effective way to get the benefits of the chemical ingredients. After the wait then i continue with my skin care. I don’t use it in the morning but i make sure to wear sunscreen everyday. Since i have sensitive skin i’m light-handed with the spray but my skin doesn’t feel stripped or tingly, it feels relaxed after i use it. I will continue to use this hoping to see a continuation of good results.","5"
"8","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I never really saw a difference with daily usage and I wore sunscreen everyday. It just didn’t work well with my skin and did nothing special for my hyperpigmentation and acne after ~7 months. It was okay, I didn’t see a big difference so I started using it on my body and it seemed more helpful there than my face.","3"
"9","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I spray a little into a cotton pad, it helped get rid of some of little bumps on my face. It did cause redness but that went away quickly","4"
"10","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Seems just okay. I was willing to try for the lower price point, but I use it more to wet my face before applying the snail mucin. I could tell no diff In texture/smoothness of my skin.","3"
"11","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","My face got dry so definitely avoid that. However the over all pour size on my face and evening out the tone, my face feeling hydrated and glowing is all green flags from this exfoliating spray thing. Once I brought the usage down to two may three days a week the results seemed more balanced then over drying my skin. My face definitely fuller brighter and less break outs.","4"
"12","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","After buying the mucin and being very happy with the results I decided to change my whole skincare regimen. I do like this but on the same hand I’ve never been someone to use toner. It has no scent like all the other Cosrx products and you get a lot for your money.","3"
"13","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It's good chemical exfoliant for the very beginner... Which I was, but after a month of using it, you'll kinda need a bit more percentage of BHA or AHA to do something to your face, at least that you can notice.","4"
"14","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I really wanted this product to work out as a chemical exfoliant, however, it actually irritated my already sensitive skin Rosacea skin. Even with the low percentage of AHA and BHA, it was a no go for me so I had to return.","3"
"15","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Came open with product missing from bottle","1"
"16","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Love this toner, have repurchased multiple times. The only reason this review is 4 stars and not 5 is that the spritzer pump always gives out 7/8 of the way through the bottle","4"
"17","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It might be a little strong for my skin. I broke out with it and my skin often feels itchy and dry and rough even after moisturizing","3"
"18","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I received the product opened with the ripped seal","1"
"19","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","This was like using water. It did nothing for my face","2"
"20","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It does a good job with toning but I had severe break out after using it and I didnt realize it until my friend who is a esthetician told me that it was because of my toner.","2"
"21","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Not sure if I super love it. I have sensitive skin so I was worried about any bumps or breakouts. So far my face seems ok. Not sure if I glow or anything wow.","3"
"22","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It didn't do much. Smelled funny and it didn't come properly sealed. Had to return it.","2"
"23","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I feel like this is an OK toner but for some reason it broke me out and I couldn't figure out what it was until I switched toners.","3"
"24","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","This toner is good enough. It's very light and subtle. Definitely doesn't strip your skin of oils, slightly hydrating in fact.","3"
"25","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Item came damaged. The box and cap were both open and the toner leaked all over.","3"
"26","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It feels nice, super light weight...but haven't noticed much of a change. I guess I was hoping for a miracle, considering I have a lot to fix as far as my skin goes, but just not super impressed with the overall product.","3"
"27","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Really dried out my sensitive skin. ","2"

"29","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I feel like my pores are getting even bigger since using this item...","2"
"30","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Terrible. Burns on contact, then face will stay irritated for days","1"
"31","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Use daily, can’t tell if it works as well as it’s been advertised by the ads. But I thought I’ll give it a try. Probably will not purchase again.","3"
"32","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","This toner doesn’t strip my skin like the witch hazel brand toner. I’d recommend this.","4"
"33","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I understand why this product receives 5 star reviews. I am in my 60's & use it every day. I have said goodbye to a dull complexion & blackheads on my nose. It not too harsh for my sensitive skin. It truly is a winner.","5"
"34","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Insane. i’ve had blackheads on my nose for YEARS that would never go away, no matter what i did. i used this stuff 2 TIMES and my blackheads are so much smaller!! hasn’t helped my redness yet, but i’m hopeful. if you’re doubtful get the little one like i did. this stuff is amazing!!!","5"
"35","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00"," It’s just really small. I honestly thought it would’ve been a bit bigger. But I guess as a trial run it’s not too bad if I like it and it works for me then I’ll get the bigger one!","4"
"36","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I only used this once and seen a difference. I’m trying the travel size rn but I think Ima get the real deal once I finish this one. And it doesn’t dry out your skin at all! Great for oily skin type like mine","4"
"37","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","It made my skin very dry and didn't see any difference on my skin and I've used it daily for weeks. ","1"
"38","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","This product works wonders when used correctly and consistently!  I noticed a difference when done consistently but when I would only remember to use it once a week I wouldn’t see any difference. It also makes your face feel greasy but I got used to it! Make sure to use a good moisturizer with it as it will dry out your skin! Definitely try if you have textured skin!","5"
"39","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","The bottle on this is so thick and rigid that it’s hard to press to calibrate the amount you want to use. I end up wasting a lot of it. Won’t use again.","3"
"40","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Beware! What I received was not the real stuff. The bottle and consistency are different.","1"
"41","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I have been using this product for years. Makes pores look smaller and clears up majority of blackheads. Just pat it into your skin!","4"
"42","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I’ve used this product for a couple of years, and have never noticed any smell until this purchase. This one smells different than my previous bottles. Haven’t noticed any reaction - although I only use it twice a week- but think it’s a bit odd.","4"
"43","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","If you're not familiar with Paula's Choice products, do yourself a favor and check out the website. Paula Begoun made a name for herself investigating beauty & skin care products, first with books and then with the website beautypedia (now sadly defunct). She looks at what is actually in products and whether those ingredients, in amounts given, have been shown through studies to be effective. Her work clued me in that it's not about price and glamour, it's about effectiveness. This BHA liquid is one of her best sellers. (I purchase PC products on Amazon only when I have a gift card.) I use BHA weekly on body and biweekly on face. If you struggle with breakouts, it can be used every day. It's a great exfoliant.","5"
"44","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Thin liquid non foaming chemical exfoliant. It works but hard to get used to using.","2"
"45","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","This one had a weird smell to it. Not sure why.. it came sealed though an wasn't expired so don't know why it smells.","3"
"46","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I heard really good things about this brand, which is why I was extremely disappointed seeing that my item arrived broken. It had leaked all all over the bottle and a good amount is missing.","3"
"47","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","First time bought was great, second time it smelled completely different (like sulfur?) and doesn’t work ","1"
"48","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I used to often have breakouts on the lower part of my face. Miraculously I seem to have less of these after using this Paula’s Choice. It also helped shrink the pores and fine lines on my face! I am not as conscious of my face now that the wrinkles and blackheads are not as apparent now","5"
"49","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Only reason I give this product a low score is because this is NOT a good product for acne or acne prone skin. Do not buy if you have problematic skin such as myself.","2"
"50","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I got this to help with my whiteheads (not the pus pimples but the ones that look like raised bumpy skin) and after a week of using it I could already see a noticeable change. It helped get rid of the smaller pimples and helped reduce the size of the bigger ones. Overall it worked pretty well, would recommend!","4"
"51","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Well I have to travel 25 min away to return a half empty bottle that was delivered to me damaged??? ZERO STARS","1"
"52","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","OMG this stuff is great! When I tell you everyone asks me what use on my skin. It’s perfect right the shower, morning and night, just put a little on a cotton pad and wipe over your face, sometimes you’ll see all the extra dirt it removes. It’s lightweight, and can replace any witch hazel or toner you’re currently using and it makes your skin GLOW. Also, for the price it last a while even while using it twice a day, I’m about to purchase my second bottle now.","5"
"53","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I have not given this product time to see results. Not sure if I can use this due to the horrible odor of the product. The expiration date is 2026, but oh my gosh, it smells rotten!!!","2"
"54","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I have been using the product for 14 days already but I haven’t seen astounding improvement.  Pores are still very visible, dark spots are not removed nor they lightened up, and skin texture is pretty much the same as day one.","3"
"55","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Smells just like latex paint and smells very strongly. Huge turnoff for this product. Used for about 2 weeks and saw no noticeable difference but definitely couldn’t stand the smell.","1"
"56","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I have spent THOUSANDS, and I mean TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars looking for a skin care product like this one. Just BUY IT. I noticed an immediate change. I was a little worried about it irritating my skin bc I have super sensitive skin, but it has been nothing short of a miracle for my skin. Zero sensitivity reactions, nothing but positive results. No more hormonal break outs, no more dry/flaky skin, no more uneven tone, no more rough texture. 10/10","5"
"57","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I tried this one after the gentler exfoliating gels didn't seem to do anything, and my skin turned very red. I guess it may work, but I can't use it until my skin gets more used to the gentler ones, I guess.","3"
"58","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Be sure to look at the ounces on the bottle or you’ll be very surprised and disappointed when you get this. With that being said, I’ve only had it for two days so I’ll come back after I’ve used it more","3"
"59","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","It’s helped in some cases but not cleaning out my pores as much as I’d like to see.","3"
"60","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","My skin is oily and acne prone I haven’t lived this product makes me break out more and produce way more oil","2"
"61","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","It may work, but it smells terrible. Smells like a throw up , so I won’t use it. I wonder if I received a bad batch.","2"
"62","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","The bottle says to increase usage to daily use eventually but that is wayyy too much for sensitive skin! Only use like once a week for those with sensitive skin. I stopped using this because it was too harsh for my skin.","3"
"63","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","This stuff makes my skin baby smooth, I have very dry textured skin and after about a week (I’ve been using this for almost a year now) my face felt like a baby’s butt. I use it every night and follow with moisturizer and my skin has never felt better","5"
"64","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Wouldn't recommend to use it every day 1 a day or especially twice a day if you have sensitive skin, because it dried my face out and was breaking my skin barrier","3"
"65","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","It has a funny smell that I’m not a fan of. I’ve used it for over a month and have seen no results. I will continue to use it day and night until I’m done with the product. I will not be buying it again .","2"
"66","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","This product is truly magic in a bottle. If I am ever breaking out or feel as though my skin has too much texture, I put this product on at night and wake up with the texture and pimple almost completely gone. Seriously this stuff is great. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out!!!!","5"
"67","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","This product made my skin feel like it was burning and made my face very red. It did not help with my pores.","3"
"68","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I thought the product would be bigger for the price but I didn’t notice any difference in my skin","2"
"69","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","It used to not smell this bad, but it literally smells rotten. I hate putting it on my face because of the rotten smell. Maybe I got a bad bottle?","3"
"70","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Will purchase again!","5"
"71","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","NOT WORTH NO 13 DOLLARS COULD GET A WHOLE MEAL. Literally smaller than a mini water bottle","3"
"72","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","It feels amazing on my skin. I could tell that it’s definitely cleaning deep into my skin to get to my annoying pores. But it works great for me. ","5"
"73","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Great for someone with a basic skincare routine trying to step it up a little. Pores do seem significantly smaller/cleaner","4"
"74","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","OMG is all i will say about this product. Everyone should buy it. I am an esthetician and use professional products but this is so far the closest product and most affordable to anything professional that i have ever used. All my clients have this at home","5"
"75","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Don’t waste your money, hasn’t done anything to help me with blackheads nor does it help to prevent breakouts.","1"
"76","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","The product is so small and for the price is just exaggeration","2"
"77","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I didn't see a very noticeable difference using this even after a month of use. That being said, it is good on sensitive skin and feels nice on your skin.","3"
"78","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","I bought this as a last ditch effort to keep up with natural deodorant. For years I've tried every big brand with zero luck. Even right out of the shower, after scrubbing with soap, I still feel like my body odor is there. I read somewhere that glycolic acid toner could help, so I figured I'd give this a try. I had this overnighted, tried it this morning by applying right after the shower, used my natural deodorant, and no kidding 12 hours later I smell fresh!! I had a really active day running around outdoors and am ending my day feeling and smelling clean. It's incredible. If you're suffering from body odor try this.","5"
"79","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","I've been using this toner at least once a day after washing my face & it has done nothing but make my face break out on each side. I have acne scars from it now. It smells great but that's about it.","2"
"80","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","I really like Thayer products. I am a daily user of the rose alcohol, free toner, and when I saw that this had some extra skin care attributes, I bought it right away. It is gentle, but effective. It moisturizers, and a good base preparation for other type of topical moisturizers. I believe it is good on fine lines.","5"
"81","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","Gentle and nice","3"
"82","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","A friend told me she always uses toner and it's good for your skin so I got this to try. I don't know, I haven't really noticed a difference with this product, but it also didn't do anything bad to my skin either. It smells ok and feels ok. I'll keep using it and see if it just needs more time.","3"
"83","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","Thayer’s 2% AHA toner is high quality. Fragrance free and is easy to use by squeezing a little onto a cotton ball. Contains effective ingredients such as glycolic and lactic acids with witch hazel. 12 oz bottle.","3"
"84","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","Whenever I use this toner it burn my face up .however it's a good toner just doesn't work for me.","2"
"85","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","If this was the original witch hazel I'd rate it 5 stars because I really love the original and how it feels/works. So if you're looking for a great, refreshing, pore toner then this brand in general is great. The issue here for me is that it is advertised as being a glycolic acid product, which I have used before, and was expecting to have similar results with this product. Let's just say the amount in here must be little to basically none because it hasn't given any results even slightly exfoliating or brightening or whatever. It feels and acts exactly like the regular witch hazel formula. I feel like it's false advertising and if I would have known that I wouldn't have ordered it. I would have ordered a glycolic acid product that actually works, and a bottle of the regular witch hazel separately. Pretty irritating, really. The scent is nice at least. So if you're looking for some actual results, I wouldn't recommend this product.","3"
"86","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","This product is so ""filtered"" (meaning watered down) it has no cleaning power at all. You're better off just washing your face with plain water.","1"
"87","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","Not sure why this says hydrating on the bottle. It has witch hazel which is an astringent. I would say this felt like a watered down version of a typical bottle of witch hazel. Good as a refreshing splash and dirt removal but I did not feel any hydration effect. It wasnt bad but would not buy again as I like a bit of a hydration feeling with my toners.","2"
"88","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","The toner didn't have any noticeable scent. It had a open top spout which allows you to use a a cotton pad/round. Personally, I like my toners in spray bottles so I can spray it while I am working to refresh my face. The toner is refreshing and feels nice during a hot summer day when I leave the bottle in the fridge.","4"
"89","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","This purchase is for a pack of two. But when the package arrived, only one bottle was in it. It looks like the other bottle was ripped out","1"

"91","The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution","100","8.99","Does not burn the face, very pleasant smell. I use it twice a week and very happy with the results on my face. My face became smoother that is for sure. I love the fact that the product doesn't dry my skin. 100% recommend.","5"
"92","The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution","100","8.99","Not sure it's working for me although I just started using it let's see what will happen","3"
"93","The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution","100","8.99","The combination of acids and witch hazel is no joke! This definitely pulls out every and any last spec of hidden dirt, debris and oil from the skin as an amazing toner, and the acids go to work helpful to shed the dead layer of skin. Super exfoliating. I love that it’s has no artificial fragrance, as perfume and toner are NOT a skin friendly mix. My skin wants to freak out just thinking about perfume on my freshly and seriously and chemically exfoliated skin.","5"
"94","The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution","100","8.99","I haven’t used this product yet but for the fact that it was delivered with amount of fluids and not filled up to the top. Umm yea.","2"

"96","The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution","100","8.99","I thought it was ordinary glycolic acid and bought it. I should have checked the brand before buying it. Definitely returning it.","2"
"97","The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution","100","8.99","Buyers please be more attentive than me and notice that this is NOT the ordinary brand!!!! It’s awful that when you search for The Ordinary this product shows up in search results. And if you have poor eyesight it’s hard to see that this isn’t the right brand because of the packaging.","1"

"101","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","I have used this toner for a few months now and it has no noticeable benefits. It feels sticky on face when dry. The salicylic acid concentration is too low to do anything or feel like a better toner would. Don’t bother.","1"
"102","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","I don't see or feel any difference after using this for months. Perhaps not worth the price. The smell isn't all that bad. It didn't aggravate my skin either. In fact, I feel like it does nothing...","3"

"104","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","I've not used it very long but it doesn't sting unless I accidently put it on where I've just threaded or have broken skin.

"105","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","When I would use this my face would literally sting.

"106","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","This product is working great so far, BUT it’s advertised as alcohol-free and the bottle I received is not???

"112","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","I normally use The Ordinary Glycolic Acid to help with my underarms. When using that product, I never had any issues. This one however, doesn't seem to have the same effect. It seems very watered down and also there is a lot of fragrance in it for a leave on treatment (so be careful if using this on the face/sensitive skin).","3"
"113","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","The website doesn't list the ingredients. It has parabens, fragrance and dyes - all of which I try to avoid. It smells like baby powder. It had no seal or wrap on it which is suspicious. I am returning it.","1"
"114","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","Its ok. Stings a bit..do not think.its doing well. I won't buy again. Good price though","2"
"115","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","Great product, but contains known carcinogenics that aren’t worth the risk.

"116","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","It caused my face to break out in a way it never has before. I stopped using it, and it was 3 weeks before my skin got back to normal. Gave it to my friend, who gave it to her 13 year old. His skin looks great. So maybe for the teens and not for those with acne and wrinkles.","1"
"117","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","This very well could be bottled colored water for all I can tell. I will say that I appreciate that they made me look for something else. I wouldn't recommend this.","2"

"123","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","It’s a little greasy after it dries and I’ve noticed it’s a blue tint so it makes my skin a little blueish. Not using anymore.","3"
"124","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","I got chemical burns on both of my checks after one use. The description said it was unscented but it smelled like old lady perfume and fermented orange....not pleasant at all. Sadly disappointed because of all the great reviews got this to try to clear up some closed comedones. Did nothing but burn me and ruin my skin for 2 weeks..","1"

"130","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","This product is fantastic. Best ""toner"" I have ever used! Cleans the skin, removes oil without overdrying. Has helped clear up my adult acne like no other product I have tried.","5"
"131","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","Love love love love this toner. It has been my go to toner for almost two years now. It has worked wonders on my acne scars and does a great job of getting excess diet and grime off skin after double cleansing. If you have acne scarring I definitely recommend. It is also not irritating and I have very sensitive skin. But make sure you always moisturize after!","5"
"132","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","So far I really like this toner. I have sensitive skin and I’ve been breaking out a lot since being pregnant. I switched from Apple cider vinegar to this and I like it a lot. Doesn’t irritate my skin or dry it out.","4"
"133","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","I love this product for whenever I am having a breakout. I applied on a cotton pad after cleaning and before my eye cream. Great toner with a soapy fresh scent. Definitely understand the hype now for Mario Badescu products! I have oily acne prone skin for anyone wondering.","5"
"134","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","Do not care for the smell . I dont see the hype. My skin hasnt changed ... and yes I have the right skin type. Better off buying from a professional than that crap. I leave ut at 3 stars just because no bad effects, but no effect at all .","3"
"135","Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin","236","18.00","I didn’t even questioned why the product was in a ziplock bag... well turns out they had knowingly sent me a damaged product .

"137","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","The consistency of this toner is similar to astringent toners I used as a teenager. I expected this to similarly strip my skin of it's natural oils, but to my delight, this toner did not dry me out. It really does gently exfoliate my skin but thanks to the aloe, it also doesn't have dry me out. This is not like Korean toners which are a bit thicker and you can pay on. This one I apply with a cotton pad. Because it has glycolic acid, make sure you use sunscreen if you use this in the morning.","5"
"138","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","After just ONE USE, my coworkers noticed a difference and so did I. My skin is glowing and marks from recently healed pimples are fading quickly. My skin is soft and plump and radiant. A little toner goes a long way! Love this stuff WAY more than the Pixi Glow Tonic! Will be repurchasing!","5"
"139","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","I got this on accident and I won't by it again, lol. It smells kind of like clay or playdough or something, so that's no optimum. It's thin, buy it feels thick. I think thsts because it dries and makes your skin feel coated with gunk. I don't like this formula at all.","2"
"140","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","This is a very nice toner for a very reasonable price. It's a generously sized bottle for the price, has zero fragrance whatsoever, and I feel like it does a nice job of removing any remaining trace of dirt or impurity left on my face before I apply moisturizer. Most of the ingredients at least contain words that I recognize. While I don't think that it makes my pores look smaller, it does what I expect of a toner, which is to wipe away anything my cleaning routine misses and leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed without drying it out. Check, check, check.","5"
"141","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","I normally use a much stronger acid toner but I got this to start my husband on. It's very gentle but does what it's supposed to.","3"
"142","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","This toner stings a little when you fist use it but maybe that’s because I have sensitive skin, It does leave my face feeling refreshed and plump. I have noticed it’s helped a little with my spots and the brightness of my skin. I would have given it more stars if it didn’t sting.","3"
"143","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90"," I have very sensitive skin. Alot of the time it's a gamble if your face would be burning afterwards, and this didn't. Very mild and great for body acne too!","4"
"144","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","I’ve been using this toner after cleansing for a few weeks. It feels refreshing and leaves my skin feeling clean. Haven’t had any redness or reaction. Honestly can’t say for certain that I’ve noticed any extraordinary results or minimizing of the pores as it states, but I feel like it does remove that layer of dirt and residue that just a cleanser alone doesn’t get.","4"
"145","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","Goes on really smooth and doesn't take much, so its a really nice moisturizer. Seems to firm up skin almost instantly. Nice scent and an all around good product","4"
"146","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","This toner is great for brightening or giving your skin a beautiful radiant glow. If you have dark marks, hyperpigmentation or dull skin - try this! Cruelty free is always a plus!","5"
"147","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","I used this for the first time and I’m impressed so far! I can’t see the difference just yet but my skin feels more firmer, breathable and cleaner! No harshness or irritation so far. The scent of this product smells light and clean! I definitely recommend trying this out if you’re looking for a good useful toner.","5"
"148","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","This does a nice job, and does appear to remove more dirt than a typical toner, without harshness.","5"
"149","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","I used this toner for four days straight to see just how well it would work on my face. I have combination skin and this left my skin feeling moisturized and without any tight skin feeling. It's on the thinner side and using it on a cotton round got rid of all leftover dirt,oiliness,and grime after washing. I was amazed at what came off after washing my face! I went about using my serum & eye cream after,my skin seemed brighter,perhaps because of all the junk that came off. The scent is super mild and is barely noticeable which is how I prefer. Hopefully the main ingredients will keep on helping my skin. I would recommend this to any kind of skin unless it's super dry,although you could probably use a good night mask or cream.","5"
"150","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","A nice glycolic acid toner that leaves skin feeling soft and glowing. I like to use this after washing with a 10% glycolic acid face wash, and then applying a retinol serum after the toner has dried. I didn’t experience any sensitivity, but I am used to using glycolic acid products on my skin. I did feel that it helped a lot to counteract dullness after I caught a Christmas cold and was sick for a few days. It recommends to use around 3 times a week, but I tend to use it for the 3 days before a special event or party.","5"
"151","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","I'm really liking this toner. It cleans up what a regular cleanser leaves behind. It leaves my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth. I don't find it harsh at all. It looks to have some good ingredients in it too. I'm very pleased with it.","5"
"152","Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner ","236","12.90","These pretty much has no scent at all. It has a mild burning and warming feeling when you first apply it, it only lasts for about 5 minutes at the most. I have unusually large pores, so I am hoping that this helps to minimize them.","3"

"154","Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator ","236","35.00","This seems to be unscented which is fine. It has a unique applicator. You place your swab or cloth on top of the bottle and push down to squirt the product up. The best thing is that is did leave my skin feeling softer and smoother. I feel like it has also evened out the texture of my skin more. I love that it contains aloe vera which is heaven for my skin. Having mature skin though I don't use it everyday as I try not use PHA daily. But it is quite effective using it just a few times a week. Highly recommend!","5"
"155","Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator ","236","35.00","I have eczema and am very limited in what I can use for chemical exfoliation. This is great-- extremely gentle, and doesn't make you more prone to sunburn. I think most people could easily use this every day. Because my skin is so sensitive and I use tretinoin, I only use 1-2x a week, but it has made a noticeable difference on my skin.","5"
"156","Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator ","200","35.00","This toner/exfoliant is wonderful for sensitive skin. I use it everyday. My skin is toned and glowing.

"157","Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator ","200","35.00","My skin feels great and smooth after use, and daily my skin looks better. Goes along well with my other skincare products. Love the way it dispenses, although sometimes it's better to have it like it usually is, but with this one it's perfect and easy for application.","3"
"158","Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator ","200","35.00","I love that this is a pump dispenser. It's so much nicer to use.

"160","Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator ","200","35.00","This toner comes in a large 6.7 oz bottle. The smell is so small that you probably won't notice it.

"182","Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ","120","17.97","I got this at Walmart, and was so excited to try it, but i cant seem to get past the stench. At first there’s no smell at all but the moment you dispense it onto a cotton round, there’s a smell similar to mildew or laundry that you forgot to put into the dryer. Its unfortunate as I was really looking forward to it, but if you hold your breath until the next product you put on, its salvageable…ish. I thought I got a bad batch, but turns out most of the reviews on their site state this as well.","2"

There seems to be a never ending amount in there which is also a plus.","4"

I’ve been using it everyday for about a month and I also got the toner for blackheads. I haven’t noticed any help in the amount of blackheads nor does it help the appearance. My blackheads are strictly on my nose. But this has made my skin very soft and it feels well hydrated throughout the day.","3"

This has become a staple in my daily night routine. I've had very oily skin, large pores, acne and blackheads since I was a teenager and I'm now in my late 30s and still get hormonal flair ups. Since using this product it has greatly improved my skins appearance. It looks and feels healthier. My blackheads are gone and my pores have decreased. I still get oily throughout the day but it's better than it used to be. I'm definitely more confident about my skin now.","5"

It can be drying at first, so make sure you aren’t overusing the product and keep it to only a few times a week at first to avoid over-drying.

I’m really big on my skin care routine because I have cystic acne and this by far one of my favorite toners. I’ve been using ole heinricksens dark spot toner but this is the closest for acne scars and dark spots… at a fraction of the cost. Also it’s moisturizing and doesn’t dry the skin out, which I love.
