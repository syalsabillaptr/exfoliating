1,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,Nothing specialÉ it seems to work. I have sensitive skin and so far so good.,3
2,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"ItÕs really nice and refreshing when used. Soothing in fact. I have acne and combination sensitive skin. This doesnÕt make my skin burn/irritated.  Overall, this is a good toner.",4
3,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,Not sure if this does a lot - no scent which is good,3
4,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,I love this product. It actually changed my skin from acne prone to smooth and clear. It also decreased my pores and helped me with black heads and white heads. Love this product and definitely gonna buy it again.,5
5,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,The bottle was not sealed in any way,2
6,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,This toner left my face feeling tight and dry,3
7,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"This product save my skin, I will forever repurchase because it is worth it.

Please try it if you are considering!",5
8,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,It helped get rid of some of little bumps on my face. It did cause redness but that went away quickly,4
9,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"My face got dry so definitely avoid that. However the over all pour size on my face and evening out the tone, my face feeling hydrated and glowing is all green flags from this exfoliating spray thing. The results seemed more balanced then over drying my skin. My face definitely fuller brighter and less break outs.",4
10,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"It's good chemical exfoliant for the very beginner... Which I was, but after a month of using it, you'll kinda need a bit more percentage of BHA or AHA to do something to your face, at least that you can notice.",4
11,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,Came open with product missing from bottle,1
12,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"Love this toner, have repurchased multiple times. The only reason this review is 4 stars and not 5 is that the spritzer pump always gives out 7/8 of the way through the bottle",4
13,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,I received the product opened with the ripped seal,1
14,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,This was like using water. It did nothing for my face,2
15,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,It does a good job with toning but I had severe break out after using it and I didnt realize it until my friend who is a esthetician told me that it was because of my toner.,2
16,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,It didn't do much. Smelled funny and it didn't come properly sealed. Had to return it.,2
17,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,I feel like this is an OK toner but for some reason it broke me out and I couldn't figure out what it was until I switched toners.,3
18,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"This toner is good enough. It's very light and subtle. Definitely doesn't strip your skin of oils, slightly hydrating in fact.",4
19,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,Item came damaged. The box and cap were both open and the toner leaked all over.,3
20,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"It feels nice, super light weight...but haven't noticed much of a change. I guess I was hoping for a miracle, considering I have a lot to fix as far as my skin goes, but just not super impressed with the overall product.",3
21,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,Really dried out my sensitive skin.Ê,2
22,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,DidnÕt notice a difference in my skin.,3
23,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,I feel like my pores are getting even bigger since using this item...,2
24,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"Terrible. Burns on contact, then face will stay irritated for days",1
25,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,"Use daily, canÕt tell if it works. But I thought IÕll give it a try. Probably will not purchase again.",3
26,COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner,This toner doesnÕt strip my skin like the witch hazel brand toner. IÕd recommend this.,4
27,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,I understand why this product receives 5 star reviews. I am in my 60's & use it every day. I have said goodbye to a dull complexion & blackheads on my nose. It not too harsh for my sensitive skin. It truly is a winner.,5
28,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"INSANE!. iÕve had blackheads on my nose for YEARS that would never go away, no matter what i did. i used this stuff 2 TIMES and my blackheads are so much smaller!! hasnÕt helped my redness yet, but iÕm hopeful. if youÕre doubtful get the little one like i did. this stuff is amazing!!!",5
29,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant, ItÕs just really small. I honestly thought it wouldÕve been a bit bigger. But I guess as a trial run itÕs not too bad if I like it and it works for me then IÕll get the bigger one!,4
30,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,I only used this once and seen a difference. IÕm trying the travel size right now. And it doesnÕt dry out your skin at all! Great for oily skin type like mine,4
31,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,It made my skin very dry and didn't see any difference on my skin and I've used it daily for weeks. ,1
32,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,The bottle on this is so thick and rigid that itÕs hard to press to calibrate the amount you want to use. I end up wasting a lot of it. WonÕt use again.,3
33,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,Beware! What I received was not the real stuff. The bottle and consistency are different.,1
34,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,I have been using this product for years. Makes pores look smaller and clears up majority of blackheads. Just pat it into your skin!,4
35,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"IÕve used this product for a couple of years, and have never noticed any smell until this purchase. This one smells different than my previous bottles. HavenÕt noticed any reaction ",4
36,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,This is one of my favorite products ever! I love everything about it! Great price!,5
37,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,Thin liquid non foaming chemical exfoliant. It hard to get used to using.,2
38,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,This one had a weird smell to it. Not sure why.. it came sealed though an wasn't expired so don't know why it smells.,3
39,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,it smelled completely bad (like sulfur?) and doesnÕt work ,1
40,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,This is NOT a good product for acne or acne prone skin. Do not buy if you have problematic skin such as myself.,2
41,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"It helped get rid of the smaller pimples and helped reduce the size of the bigger ones. Overall it worked pretty well, would recommend!",4
42,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,Well I have to travel 25 min away to return a half empty bottle that was delivered to me damaged??? ZERO STARS,1
43,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"OMG this stuff is great! When I tell you everyone asks me what use on my skin. ItÕs perfect right the shower, morning and night, just put a little on a cotton pad and wipe over your face, sometimes youÕll see all the extra dirt it removes. ItÕs lightweight, and can replace any witch hazel or toner youÕre currently using and it makes your skin GLOW. Also, for the price it last a while even while using it twice a day, IÕm about to purchase my second bottle now.",5
44,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"I have not given this product time to see results. Not sure if I can use this due to the horrible odor of the product. The expiration date is 2026, but oh my gosh, it smells rotten!!!",2
45,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,Smells just like latex paint and smells very strongly. Huge turnoff for this product. Used for about 2 weeks and saw no noticeable difference but definitely couldnÕt stand the smell.,1
46,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,My skin is oily and acne prone I havenÕt lived this product makes me break out more and produce way more oil,2
47,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"It may work, but it smells terrible. Smells like a throw up , so I wonÕt use it. I wonder if I received a bad batch.",2
48,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,The bottle says to increase usage to daily use eventually but that is way too much for sensitive skin! Only use like once a week for those with sensitive skin. I stopped using this because it was too harsh for my skin.,3
49,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,I really love this product it helps clear my skin from getting break out especially in my forehead within a few days I saw changes. I will be purchasing again. ItÕs really a great size.,5
50,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"Wouldn't recommend to use it every day 1 a day or especially twice a day if you have sensitive skin, because it dried my face out and was breaking my skin barrier",3
51,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,It has a funny smell that IÕm not a fan of. IÕve used it for over a month and have seen no results.  I will not be buying it again .,2
52,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"This product is truly magic in a bottle. If I am ever breaking out or feel as though my skin has too much texture, I put this product on at night and wake up with the texture and pimple almost completely gone. Seriously this stuff is great. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out!!!!",5
53,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,This product made my skin feel like it was burning and made my face very red. It did not help with my pores.,3
54,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,I thought the product would be bigger for the price but I didnÕt notice any difference in my skin,2
55,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"It used to not smell this bad, but it literally smells rotten. I hate putting it on my face because of the rotten smell. ",3
56,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,NOT WORTH NO 13 DOLLARS. Literally smaller than a mini water bottle,1
57,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,It feels amazing on my skin. I could tell that itÕs definitely cleaning deep into my skin to get to my pores. But it works great for me.Ê,5
58,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,Great for someone with a basic skincare routine trying to step it up a little. Pores do seem significantly smaller or cleaner,4
59,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,OMG. Everyone should buy it. This is so far the closest product and most affordable to anything professional that i have ever used. ,5
60,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"DonÕt waste your money, hasnÕt done anything to help me with blackheads nor does it help to prevent breakouts.",1
61,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,The product is so small and for the price is just exaggeration,2
62,Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant,"I didn't see a very noticeable difference using this even after a month of use. That being said, it is good on sensitive skin and feels nice on your skin.",3
63,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","It's very gentle on my skin and makes my face feel clean and refreshed without drying it or causing any redness, irritation, or stinging. I'm already seeing an improvement in the size of my pores and skin tone since I started using this. The exfoliation impact is very gentle yet effective. My skin feels smoother, softer, and has a healthy glow again. I think this toner would be safe for people with sensitive skin too. This is an excellent addition to my skin care routine, and I highly recommend it.",5
64,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",I've been using this toner at least once a day after washing my face & it has done nothing but make my face break out on each side. I have acne scars from it now. It smells great but that's about it.,2
65,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","I really like Thayer products. I am a daily user of the rose alcohol, free toner, and when I saw that this had some extra skin care attributes, I bought it right away. It is gentle, but effective. It moisturizers, and a good base preparation for other type of topical moisturizers. I believe it is good on fine lines.",5
66,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",Gentle and nice,4
67,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","A friend told me she always uses toner and it's good for your skin so I got this to try. I don't know, I haven't really noticed a difference with this product, but it also didn't do anything bad to my skin either. It smells ok and feels ok. I'll keep using it and see if it just needs more time.",3
68,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",ThayerÕs 2% AHA toner is high quality. Fragrance free and is easy to use by squeezing a little onto a cotton ball.,4
69,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",Whenever I use this toner it burn my face up. However it's a good toner just doesn't work for me.,2
70,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","If you're looking for a great, refreshing, pore toner then this brand in general is great.But it hasn't given any results even slightly exfoliating or brightening or whatever. I feel like it's false advertising and if I would have known that I wouldn't have ordered it. Pretty irritating, really. I wouldn't recommend this product.",3
71,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",This product has no cleaning power at all. You're better off just washing your face with plain water.,1
72,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",Not sure why this says hydrating on the bottle. It has witch hazel which is an astringent. I would say this felt like a watered down version of a typical bottle of witch hazel. Good as a refreshing splash and dirt removal but I did not feel any hydration effect. It wasn't bad but would not buy again as I like a bit of a hydration feeling with my toners.,2
73,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel",The toner didn't have any noticeable scent.  The toner is refreshing and feels nice.,4
74,"Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","This purchase is for a pack of two. But when the package arrived, only one bottle was in it. It looks like the other bottle was ripped out",1
75,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"i like it, still in review for myself but i havenÕt used it enough to see results, my own fault.",3
76,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"Does not burn the face, very pleasant smell. I use it twice a week and very happy with the results on my face. My face became smoother that is for sure. I love the fact that the product doesn't dry my skin. 100% recommend.",5
77,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Not sure it's working for me although I just started using it let's see what will happen.,3
78,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,"The combination of acids and witch hazel is no joke! This definitely pulls out every and any last spec of hidden dirt, debris and oil from the skin as an amazing toner, and the acids go to work helpful to shed the dead layer of skin. Super exfoliating. I love that itÕs has no artificial fragrance, as perfume and toner are NOT a skin friendly mix. My skin wants to freak out just thinking about perfume on my freshly and seriously and chemically exfoliated skin.",5
79,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,I havenÕt used this product yet but for the fact that it was delivered with amount of fluids and not filled up to the top.,2
80,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,it doesn't work don't waste your money on it . instead just spend the extra few bucks on the ordinary one,2
81,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,I thought it was ordinary glycolic acid and bought it. I should have checked the brand before buying it. Definitely returning it.,2
82,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,Buyers please be more attentive than me and notice that this is NOT the ordinary brand!!!! ItÕs awful that when you search for The Ordinary this product shows up in search results. And if you have poor eyesight itÕs hard to see that this isnÕt the right brand because of the packaging.,1
83,The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution,i ordered this yesterday for it to show up and feel like im putting sweet and sour sauce on my skin. it smells like nothing but looks and feels nothing like the ordinary toner. waste of money and my time.,1
84,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,I am not sure of any other change except 2 white bumps I had on my face. They wouldn't pop and were slowing getting bigger. This product is getting them away. I added a before and after for one of the bumps.,3
85,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,This makes my skin feel and look great. It is not drying at all. Love it and is worth the price.,4
86,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,I have used this toner for a few months now and it has no noticeable benefits. It feels sticky on face when dry. The salicylic acid concentration is too low to do anything or feel like a better toner would. DonÕt bother.,1
87,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,When I would use this my face would literally sting. I went to the gym and worked out and it somehow like reactivated or something and it felt like my face was burning off and it was as bright as a tomato. I had to run to the locker room to wash my face.,1
88,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"Unfortunately, this toner did nothing for my skin. I tried it every day for a month and saw zero results. I returned the product.",2
89,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,This glycolic acid toner is great for occasional use but recommend against daily use. It has made my skin clear and tighter,4

91,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"I love this product so much, I now have my mom and daughter using it with great results",4
92,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"I donÕt have super sensitive skin but it made my face breakout. Also, the smell is terrible I had to stop using it. Went back to my old stuff",3
93,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"I normally use The Ordinary Glycolic Acid to help with my underarms. When using that product, I never had any issues. This one however, doesn't seem to have the same effect. It seems very watered down and also there is a lot of fragrance in it for a leave on treatment (so be careful if using this on the face/sensitive skin).",3
94,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"The website doesn't list the ingredients. It has parabens, fragrance and dyes - all of which I try to avoid. It smells like baby powder. It had no seal or wrap on it which is suspicious. I am returning it.",1
95,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,Its ok. Stings a bit..do not think.its doing well. I won't buy again. ,2
96,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"Great product, but contains known carcinogenics that arenÕt worth the risk. I recommend switching to the version offered by The Ordinary to get the same great results without the side of cancer. ",2
97,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,It caused my face to break out in a way it never has before. I stopped using it.,1
98,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"Great toner for once a day use for someone with dry/sensitive skin looking for non drying solution. Great scent, too.",4
99,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"I received it in a plastic bag with no protective seal on it. So, clearly it had been opened/used. I returned it.",1
100,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,Smells very fragrant for something supposedly unscented. I had an allergic reaction I believe to Limonene.,1
101,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,ItÕs a little greasy after it dries and IÕve noticed itÕs a blue tint so it makes my skin a little blueish. Not using anymore.,3
102,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,I got chemical burns on both of my checks after one use. Sadly disappointed because of all the great reviews got this to try to clear up some closed comedones. Did nothing but burn me and ruin my skin for 2 weeks..,1
103,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"My skin worsened after the first couple of uses. I was breaking out more, and my skin was drier than ever.",1
104,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,Horrible made my face breakout like crazy,1
105,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"This was a waste of money, it didn't help my skin in any way, it made my skin oily and I broke out even more.",2
106,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"It left my skin sticky and made me break out. For the price, not worth it.",2
107,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,This is a really fantastic product. I saw the reviews were good but seeing is believing. My skin looked brighter and firmer after just a few days of use. Highly recommend.,5
108,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"This product is fantastic. Best toner I have ever used! Cleans the skin, removes oil without overdrying. Has helped clear up my adult acne like no other product I have tried.",5
109,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,So far I really like this toner. I like it a lot. DoesnÕt irritate my skin or dry it out.,4
110,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,I love this product for whenever I am having a breakout. I applied on a cotton pad after cleaning and before my eye cream. Great toner with a soapy fresh scent. Definitely understand the hype now for Mario Badescu products! I have oily acne prone skin for anyone wondering.,5
111,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"Do not care for the smell . I dont see the hype. My skin hasnt changed ... and yes I have the right skin type. Better off buying from a professional than that crap. I leave ut at 3 stars just because no bad effects, but no effect at all .",3
112,Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner for Dry and Combination Skin,"I didnÕt even questioned why the product was in a ziplock bag... well turns out they had knowingly sent me a damaged product . I just realized today that the bottle had a hole when I saw a good 2 ounces of toner leaked on my sink, fortunately I still had an empty bottle of toner and emptied out the toner into it .",1
113,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,Great item and I love that itÕs made in the USA.,4
114,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"I got this on accident and I won't by it again, lol. It smells kind of like clay or playdough or something, so that's no optimum. It's thin, buy it feels thick. I think thsts because it dries and makes your skin feel coated with gunk. I don't like this formula at all.",2
115,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"This is a very nice toner for a very reasonable price. It's a generously sized bottle for the price, has zero fragrance whatsoever, and I feel like it does a nice job of removing any remaining trace of dirt or impurity left on my face before I apply moisturizer.  While I don't think that it makes my pores look smaller, it does what I expect of a toner, which is to wipe away anything my cleaning routine misses and leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed without drying it out.",5
116,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"This toner stings a little when you fist use it but maybe thatÕs because I have sensitive skin, It does leave my face feeling refreshed and plump. I have noticed itÕs helped a little with my spots and the brightness of my skin. I would have given it more stars if it didnÕt sting.",3
117,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"ÊI have very sensitive skin. Alot of the time it's a gamble if your face would be burning afterwards, and this didn't. Very mild and great for body acne too!",4
118,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"IÕve been using this toner after cleansing for a few weeks. It feels refreshing and leaves my skin feeling clean. HavenÕt had any redness or reaction. Honestly canÕt say for certain that IÕve noticed any extraordinary results or minimizing of the pores as it states, but I feel like it does remove that layer of dirt and residue that just a cleanser alone doesnÕt get.",4
119,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"Goes on really smooth and doesn't take much, so its a really nice moisturizer. Seems to firm up skin almost instantly. Nice scent and an all around good product",4
120,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"This toner is great for brightening or giving your skin a beautiful radiant glow. If you have dark marks, hyperpigmentation or dull skin - try this! Cruelty free is always a plus!",5
121,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"This does a nice job, and does appear to remove more dirt than a typical toner, without harshness.",5
122,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"I used this toner for four days straight to see just how well it would work on my face. I have combination skin and this left my skin feeling moisturized and without any tight skin feeling. It's on the thinner side and using it on a cotton round got rid of all leftover dirt,oiliness,and grime after washing. I was amazed at what came off after washing my face! I went about using my serum & eye cream after,my skin seemed brighter,perhaps because of all the junk that came off. The scent is super mild and is barely noticeable which is how I prefer. Hopefully the main ingredients will keep on helping my skin. I would recommend this to any kind of skin unless it's super dry,although you could probably use a good night mask or cream.",5
123,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"I'm really liking this toner. It cleans up what a regular cleanser leaves behind. It leaves my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth. I don't find it harsh at all. It looks to have some good ingredients in it too. I'm very pleased with it.",5
124,Natural Outcome Glycolic Acid Toner 5% for Face - Gentle Exfoliating Toner,"These pretty much has no scent at all. It has a mild burning and warming feeling when you first apply it, it only lasts for about 5 minutes at the most. I have unusually large pores, so I am hoping that this helps to minimize them.",3
125,Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator,Medik8 are quality products and you won't be disappointed. This tonic/toner is a excellent product to prep you skin before applying other skin care.....,4
126,Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator,"This toner/exfoliant is wonderful for sensitive skin. I use it everyday. My skin is toned and glowing. No smell, no stinging. Bottle dispenser is awesome- you just press/pump it right on your cotton pad. ItÕs also green friendly.",5
127,Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator,"My skin feels great and smooth after use, and daily my skin looks better. Goes along well with my other skincare products. Love the way it dispenses, although sometimes it's better to have it like it usually is, but with this one it's perfect and easy for application.",4
128,Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator,I love that this is a pump dispenser. It's so much nicer to use. The toner is also unscented which is really nice. I had a giant pimple on my forehead and after one use it was significantly smaller and my skin was nice and glowy. I'm loving this toner.,5
129,Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator,Honestly it doesn't peel on my skin and it doesn't tighten pores,3
130,Medik8 Press & Glow Daily Exfoliating PHA Tonic with Enzyme Activator,"The smell is so small that you probably won't notice it. This is a mild toner that spreads easily on the face. The toner absorbs well and leaves my skin smooth, hydrated and radiant. I feel my skin is soft, smooth and bright. I would recommend it.",5

136,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,"I thought something was odd when it came and it was so dark in color. I tried it, and sure enough it was NOT. It burnt my skin, I have no idea what it is. It angers me that this kind of product fraud is happening.",1
137,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,"I like all of the ingredients in this, it is gentle on the skin and feels nice, however it literally smells like the penguin section at the zoo. For the amount paid, I'd expect the smell to be a little more pleasant.",3

141,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,"Read the fine print. For darker skin tones this product may have an adverse reaction. IÕm 2 shades darker than I was two weeks ago by using this product. IÕll give it two stars because itÕs not for me though it may be for someone else. Darker skinned, beware",2
142,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,I hate to be negative but I think it was soap water. Nothing special.,1
143,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,"I was wondering why when I put it on, my face started burning. ",1
144,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,This was not sealed. Literally a bottle in a larger box. Nothing wrapped or sealed. Concerning. Anything could be in this bottle.,1
145,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,Product was delivered opened and 3/4 of product spilled out,1
146,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,"This toner has done wonders for my acne scars, IÕve been using it consistently twice a day for 2-3 weeks and my dark scaring has significantly faded. There was a little sting when I first started using but I have very sensitive skin .",5

148,Versed Weekend Glow Daily Brightening Facial Toner ,"I really do like this product, I would also give it 5 stars but IÕm not a fan of how the lid works when trying to get the product out of the bottle.

After only one night of using the next day I noticed that over 90% of my blackheads were gone!!! This product wasnÕt harsh at all and I kind of doubted because of that but I am in utter shock on the results after just one use. 5 stars across the board! I will buy again and forever use!!!,5
152,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,A little tingling on application but no skin reaction so far. Removes dirt really well and clears skin too,3
153,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,"I suffer from very sensitive combination skin and was rec by a friend. THIS BRAND IS AMAZING for sensitive skin. it is by far the gentlest skincare ever. i use this product as well as their snail mucin cleanser and essence toner and WOW. note that you have to be patient to see results. i get very easily frustrated if i dont see quick results, but after about a month of using this brand all my issues have been resolved. worth the wait. im glowing and healthy, without any repercussions.",5
154,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,So far a great product. Using this as part of a routine to clear sebaceous filaments and it actually works! It is gently on the skin and does not cause irritation. Would recommend.,4
155,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,"Works pretty well for when my nose gets obnoxiously blackheaded, I'd rather squeeze em but this does the trick too just not on my most stubborn ones, I don't care what other people say. I need the extractor for those. Yes I'd order it again because it seems to be very gentle and my fiance has taken a liking to it as well. There seems to be a never ending amount in there which is also a plus.",4
156,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,I used this for about two months everyday consistently and it made the appearance of my pores look worse everyday. If i didnÕt use it my pores looked fine but if i put some on my face it made it looks like there were tiny blackheads.,1
157,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,I absolutely love this. I'm halfway through my first bottle and I will be purchasing again. This has become a staple in my daily night routine. It has greatly improved my skins appearance. It looks and feels healthier. My blackheads are gone and my pores have decreased. I still get oily throughout the day but it's better than it used to be. I'm definitely more confident about my skin now.,5
158,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,i have to give this product a fair time but I don't see anything different,3
159,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,I was skeptical about any product getting rid of blackheads because none have ever came through before. IÕve only been using a week and I can definitely tell that the blackheads I have are decreasing. I only use this on my face where I get blackheads and I see a difference. No smell and seems to be helping.,4
160,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,ItÕs making my face break out. I bought it to make my pores smaller. ItÕs not working for me. Unsatisfied with it.,1

164,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,"For a product that's supposed to work for and, it's pretty greasy/oily.",2
165,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,It hasn't cleared or even reduced any blackheads. Very disappointing.,2
166,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,I donÕt feel like it does anything it says it does. The BHA amount is too low for any real significance.,2
167,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,I wash my face and all this stuff didnÕt work for me like it did others.,2
168,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,IitÕs making my face break out. ItÕs not working for me. Unsatisfied with it.,1
169,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,"This stuff has done wonders on my pores and blackheads and for the price, I will buy again. It leave a glow on my skin, I use it every night and it doesn't irritate my skin or dry it out.",5
170,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,Nice product. It helped clear some of my acne. I didn't get any negative reaction to it. I use it every night after cleanser. I've noticed an improvement. I still get the hormonal breakout sometimes but it's not dramatic.,4
171,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,"I find that this honestly doesnÕt really do anything for my skin?? It doesnÕt make it breakout or anything, but it doesnÕt help my blackheads either. IÕve been using this for a few months and I donÕt think I will be purchasing this again.",3
172,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,I think it's causing me to purge. My face got super broken out when I first started using it. I cut back to every three days and it seems to be better.,3
173,COSRX Niacinamide 2% + BHA 4% Blackhead Exfoliant Toner,This product didn't do anything for me. It only made my face break out. Waste of money. I dumped it down the sink.,1

180,SOME BY MI AHA BHA PHA 30 Days Miracle Toner,"I purchased this toner twice and I have to say, itÕs amazing. IÕm really big on my skin care routine because I have cystic acne and this by far one of my favorite toners. IÕve been using ole heinricksens dark spot toner but this is the closest for acne scars and dark spotsÉ at a fraction of the cost. Also itÕs moisturizing and doesnÕt dry the skin out, which I love.
