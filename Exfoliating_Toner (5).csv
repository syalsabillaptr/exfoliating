"2","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I keep this in a fridge so it’s really nice and refreshing when used. Soothing in fact. I have acne and combination sensitive skin. This doesn’t make my skin burn/irritated. I’m not really expecting this product “alone” to clear my acne as it contains a really small amount of Aha&Bha in it. Overall, this is a good toner.","4"
"3","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Really not sure if this does a lot - no scent which is good","3"
"4","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I love this product. It actually changed my skin from acne prone to smooth and clear. It also decreased my pores and helped me with black heads and white heads. Love this product and definitely gonna buy it again.","5"

"6","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","This toner left my face feeling tight and dry. I've reverted to Mizon's aha toner, and my skin feels much better!","3"
"7","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","For starters i have super dry dehydrated sensitive eczema prone skin. Literally quadruple homicide. My skin always looks so dead and dull and I have many dark marks and some texture so i legit hate my bare face and try to cover it with makeup. Physical exfoliants are too aggressive to slosh off the dead skin cells too. I’ve literally used this for two nights in a row and my pores legit disappeared. I can’t find them and my face is so smooth already. I haven’t had an irritation or purging yet but i like how light it is bc i was scared to venture into the aha bha area but after research information a lot my skin concerns were a good candidate for a chemical exfoliant. I only use it at night, i let my face dry completely before spraying a light layer then i let that sit and go do something else for like 20mins while it sits. I read on multiple skincare forums that this is the most effective way to get the benefits of the chemical ingredients. After the wait then i continue with my skin care. I don’t use it in the morning but i make sure to wear sunscreen everyday. Since i have sensitive skin i’m light-handed with the spray but my skin doesn’t feel stripped or tingly, it feels relaxed after i use it. I will continue to use this hoping to see a continuation of good results.","5"
"8","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It’s ok...I never really saw a difference with daily usage and I wore sunscreen everyday. It just didn’t work well with my skin and did nothing special for my hyperpigmentation and acne after ~7 months. It was okay, I didn’t see a big difference so I started using it on my body and it seemed more helpful there than my face.","3"
"9","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I spray a little into a cotton pad, it helped get rid of some of little bumps on my face. It did cause redness but that went away quickly","4"
"10","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Seems just okay. Compared to Paula’s Choice, I don’t like it as well. I was willing to try for the lower price point, but I use it more to wet my face before applying the snail mucin. I could tell no diff In texture/smoothness of my skin.","3"
"11","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","First time buyer of this line. I made the mistake of using this everyday. My face got dry so definitely avoid that. However the over all pour size on my face and evening out the tone, my face feeling hydrated and glowing is all green flags from this exfoliating spray thing. Once I brought the usage down to two may three days a week the results seemed more balanced then over drying my skin. My face using this and other creams etc, is definitely fuller brighter and less break outs.","4"
"12","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","After buying the mucin and being very happy with the results I decided to change my whole skincare regimen. I do like this but on the same hand I’ve never been someone to use toner. It has no scent like all the other Cosrx products and you get a lot for your money.","3"
"13","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It's good chemical exfoliant for the very begginner... Which I was, but after a month of using it, you'll kinda need a bit more percentage of BHA or AHA to do something to your face, at least that you can notice. Not saying your skin gets used to it cuz that's not how it works, but it's very little percentage of them both so you'll have room to go higher little by little","4"
"14","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I really wanted this product to work out as a chemical exfoliant, however, it actually irritated my already sensitive skin Rosacea skin. Even with the low percentage of AHA and BHA, it was a no go for me so I had to return.","3"

"16","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Love this toner, have repurchased multiple times. The only reason this review is 4 stars and not 5 is that the spritzer pump always gives out 7/8 of the way through the bottle","4"
"17","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I’m not sure it does anything. It might be a little strong for my skin. I broke out with it and my skin often feels itchy and dry and rough even after moisturizing","3"

"20","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","It does a good job with toning but I had severe break out after using it and I didnt realize it until my friend who is a esthetician told me that it was because of my toner.","2"
"21","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Not sure if I super love it. I have sensitive skin so I was worried about any bumps or breakouts. So far my face seems ok. Not sure if I glow or anything wow.","3"

"24","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","This toner is good enough. I might repurchase for my teenage daughter. It's very light and subtle. Definitely doesn't strip your skin of oils, slightly hydrating in fact.","3"

"27","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","Use daily, can’t tell if it works as well as it’s been advertised by the ads. But I thought I’ll give it a try. Probably will not purchase again.","3"
"28","COSRX AHA/BHA Treatment Toner","150","18.60","I decided to give this another try and can slowly see it working. I think I gave up and became too impatient when I first tried it. My skin seems to respond better when both BHA & AHA are combine. This toner doesn’t strip my skin like the witch hazel brand toner. I’d recommend this.","4"
"29","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I understand why this product receives 5 star reviews. I am in my 60's & use it every day. I have said goodbye to a dull complexion & blackheads on my nose. It not too harsh for my sensitive skin. It truly is a winner.","5"
"30","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","insane. i’ve had blackheads on my nose for YEARS that would never go away, no matter what i did. i used this stuff 2 TIMES and my blackheads are so much smaller!! hasn’t helped my redness yet, but i’m hopeful. if you’re doubtful get the little one like i did. this stuff is amazing!!!","5"
"31","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I’ll update my review when I actually use it but it came ahead of time. It’s just really small. I honestly thought it would’ve been a bit bigger. But I guess as a trial run it’s not too bad if I like it and it works for me then I’ll get the bigger one!","4"
"32","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I only used this once and seen a difference. I’m trying the travel size rn but I think Ima get the real deal once I finish this one. And it doesn’t dry out your skin at all! Great for oily skin type like mine","4"
"33","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","It made my skin very dry and didn't see any difference on my skin and I've used it daily for weeks. I'm glad I didn't purchase a bigger bottle.","1"
"34","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","This product works wonders when used correctly and consistently! I put a small amount in my hands and pat it on my face and then wait about 15 mins before putting my moisturizer on and I do this about every other day. I noticed a difference when done consistently but when I would only remember to use it once a week I wouldn’t see any difference. It also makes your face feel greasy but I got used to it! Make sure to use a good moisturizer with it as it will dry out your skin! Definitely try if you have textured skin!","4"
"35","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","The bottle on this is so thick and rigid that it’s hard to press to calibrate the amount you want to use. I end up wasting a lot of it. Won’t use again.","3"

"38","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I’ve used this product for a couple of years, have purchased from PC website and amazon, and have never noticed any smell until this purchase. This one smells different than my previous bottles. Haven’t noticed any reaction - although I only use it twice a week- but think it’s a bit odd.","4"
"39","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","If you're not familiar with Paula's Choice products, do yourself a favor and check out the website. Paula Begoun made a name for herself investigating beauty & skin care products, first with books and then with the website beautypedia (now sadly defunct). She looks at what is actually in products and whether those ingredients, in amounts given, have been shown through studies to be effective. Her work clued me in that it's not about price and glamour, it's about effectiveness. This BHA liquid is one of her best sellers. (I purchase PC products on Amazon only when I have a gift card.) I use BHA weekly on body and biweekly on face. If you struggle with breakouts, it can be used every day. It's a great exfoliant.","5"

"44","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I used to often have break-outs on the lower part of my face. Miraculously I seem to have less of these after using this Paula’s Choice. It also helped shrink the pores and fine lines on my face! I am not as conscious of my face now that the wrinkles and blackheads are not as apparent now","5"
"45","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Only reason I give this product a low score is because this is NOT a good product for acne or acne prone skin. Do not buy if you have problematic skin such as myself.","2"
"46","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I got this to help with my whiteheads (not the pus pimples but the ones that look like raised bumpy skin) and after a week of using it I could already see a noticeable change. It helped get rid of the smaller pimples and helped reduce the size of the bigger ones. Overall it worked pretty well, would recommend!","4"

"48","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","OMG this stuff is great! When I tell you everyone asks me what use on my skin. It’s perfect right the shower, morning and night, just put a little on a cotton pad and wipe over your face, sometimes you’ll see all the extra dirt it removes. It’s lightweight, and can replace any witch hazel or toner you’re currently using and it makes your skin GLOW. Also, for the price it last a while even while using it twice a day, I’m about to purchase my second bottle now.","5"
"49","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I have not given this product time to see results. Not sure if I can use this due to the horrible odor of the product. The expiration date is 2026, but oh my gosh, it smells rotten!!!","2"
"50","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I have been using the product for 14 days already but I haven’t seen astounding improvement. Maybe after a month I’m going to experience some improvements on my skin’s texture. As of the moment, after regular use for 2 weeks (2x a day application) pores are still very visible, dark spots are not removed nor they lightened up, and skin texture is pretty much the same as day one.","4"
"51","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Smells just like latex paint and smells very strongly. Huge turnoff for this product. Used for about 2 weeks and saw no noticeable difference but definitely couldn’t stand the smell.","1"
"52","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I have spent THOUSANDS, and I mean TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars looking for a skin care product like this one. Just BUY IT. I noticed an immediate change. I was a little worried about it irritating my skin bc I have super sensitive skin, but it has been nothing short of a miracle for my skin. Zero sensitivity reactions, nothing but positive results. No more hormonal break outs, no more dry/flaky skin, no more uneven tone, no more rough texture. 10/10","5"
"53","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I tried this one after the gentler exfoliating gels didn't seem to do anything, and my skin turned very red. I guess it may work, but I can't use it until my skin gets more used to the gentler ones, I guess.","3"
"54","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","Be sure to look at the ounces on the bottle or you’ll be very surprised and disappointed when you get this. With that being said, I’ve only had it for two days so I’ll come back after I’ve used it more","3"
"55","Paulas Choice--SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant","118","35.00","I didn't see a very noticeable difference using this even after a month of use. That being said, it is good on sensitive skin and feels nice on your skin.","3"
"56","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","I bought this as a last ditch effort to keep up with natural deodorant. For years I've tried every big brand with zero luck. Even right out of the shower, after scrubbing with soap, I still feel like my body odor is there. I read somewhere that glycolic acid toner could help, so I figured I'd give this a try. I had this overnighted, tried it this morning by applying right after the shower, used my natural deodorant, and no kidding 12 hours later I smell fresh!! I had a really active day running around outdoors and am ending my day feeling and smelling clean. It's incredible. If you're suffering from body odor try this.","5"
"57","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","ve been using this toner at least once a day after washing my face & it has done nothing but make my face break out on each side. I have acne scars from it now. It smells great but that's about it.","2"
"58","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","I really like Thayer products. I am a daily user of the rose alcohol, free toner, and when I saw that this had some extra skin care attributes, I bought it right away. It is gentle, but effective. It moisturizers, and a good base preparation for other type of topical moisturizers. I believe it is good on fine lines.","5"

"60","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","A friend told me she always uses toner and it's good for your skin so I got this to try. I don't know, I haven't really noticed a difference with this product, but it also didn't do anything bad to my skin either. It smells ok and feels ok. I'll keep using it and see if it just needs more time.","3"
"61","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","Thayer’s 2% AHA toner is high quality.

"62","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","Whenever I use this toner it burn my face up .however it's a good toner just doesn't work for me.","2"
"63","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","If this was the original witch hazel I'd rate it 5 stars because I really love the original and how it feels/works. So if you're looking for a great, refreshing, pore toner then this brand in general is great. The issue here for me is that it is advertised as being a glycolic acid product, which I have used before, and was expecting to have similar results with this product. Let's just say the amount in here must be little to basically none because it hasn't given any results even slightly exfoliating or brightening or whatever. It feels and acts exactly like the regular witch hazel formula. I feel like it's false advertising and if I would have known that I wouldn't have ordered it. I would have ordered a glycolic acid product that actually works, and a bottle of the regular witch hazel separately. Pretty irritating, really. The scent is nice at least. So if you're looking for some actual results, I wouldn't recommend this product.","3"
"64","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","This product is so ""filtered"" (meaning watered down) it has no cleaning power at all. You're better off just washing your face with plain water.","1"
"65","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","Not sure why this says hydrating on the bottle. It has witch hazel which is an astringent. I would say this felt like a watered down version of a typical bottle of witch hazel. Good as a refreshing splash and dirt removal but I did not feel any hydration effect. It wasnt bad but would not buy again as I like a bit of a hydration feeling with my toners.","2"
"66","Thayers 2% AHA Exfoliating Toner with Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid and Witch Hazel","355","14.99","The toner didn't have any noticeable scent. It had a open top spout which allows you to use a a cotton pad/round. Personally, I like my toners in spray bottles so I can spray it while I am working to refresh my face. The toner is refreshing and feels nice during a hot summer day when I leave the bottle in the fridge.","4"

This definitely pulls out every and any last spec of hidden dirt, debris and oil from the skin as an amazing toner, and the acids go to work helpful to shed the dead layer of skin. Super exfoliating.

I have combination skin and this left my skin feeling moisturized and without any tight skin feeling. It's on the thinner side and using it on a cotton round got rid of all leftover dirt,oiliness,and grime after washing. I was amazed at what came off after washing my face! I went about using my serum & eye cream after,my skin seemed brighter,perhaps because of all the junk that came off. The scent is super mild and is barely noticeable which is how I prefer. Hopefully the main ingredients will keep on helping my skin. I would recommend this to any kind of skin unless it's super dry,although you could probably use a good night mask or cream.","5"

I like to use this after washing with a 10% glycolic acid face wash, and then applying a retinol serum after the toner has dried. I didn’t experience any sensitivity, but I am used to using glycolic acid products on my skin. I did feel that it helped a lot to counteract dullness after I caught a Christmas cold and was sick for a few days. It recommends to use around 3 times a week, but I tend to use it for the 3 days before a special event or party.","5"

I need the extractor for those. Yes I'd order it again because it seems to be very gentle and my fiance has taken a liking to it as well. There seems to be a never ending amount in there which is also a plus.","4"

I’ve been using it everyday for about a month and I also got the toner for blackheads. I haven’t noticed any help in the amount of blackheads nor does it help the appearance. My blackheads are strictly on my nose. But this has made my skin very soft and it feels well hydrated throughout the day.","3"

This has become a staple in my daily night routine. I've had very oily skin, large pores, acne and blackheads since I was a teenager and I'm now in my late 30s and still get hormonal flair ups. Since using this product it has greatly improved my skins appearance. It looks and feels healthier. My blackheads are gone and my pores have decreased. I still get oily throughout the day but it's better than it used to be. I'm definitely more confident about my skin now.","5"

Unfortunately, Most skin care products cause irritation or chemical burns on my face (even the gentle ones). But I’ve yet to experience that with this product. I’ve struggled for years to find a product to help with my problem areas and this product is now a MUST in my skin care routine. It leaves my skin silky smooth and shiny and got rid of my black heads after a couple weeks. 10/10 would recommend!","5"

"175","SOME BY MI AHA BHA PHA 30 Days Miracle Toner","150","15.40","I started to use this daily for a whole month as recommended. And I saw results within a week. I was dealing with hormonal acne and my face was very textured with bumps and acne scars. Once I started using this my face was brighter, smoother, and my acne had gotten so much less noticeable. And it didn't sting my skin like other chemical exfoliators I've tried in the past. I wouldn't say this is a ""miracle"" product, but it is effective over time. I would definitely reccomend it!","5"

Prior to this I was using all kinds of toner and acne medications but my skin would clear up a little bit then would get bad again. I was so desperate and I found this. This toner cleared up my acne and now my skin is so clear, smooth, and hydrated. Even without foundation it looks and feels great! I know everyone’s skin is different and a product may be great for one person but maybe not be for others. This is working for me and I hope it continues to work. You won’t know until you try and this product is worth a try. I hope it works for you.","5"
"193","SOME BY MI AHA BHA PHA 30 Days Miracle Toner","150","15.40","You should not be exfoliating your skin everyday otherwise it can really damage your skin, but I use this toner twice or sometimes three times a week depending on the situation with my skin.

(I had an expensive Hydrafacial and the esthetician still had to try and manual extract my blackheads, to no avail). I've tried masks, peels, creams, lotions, manual extractions and nothing ever worked. 2 days using this and they are gone! I've been using it for over a year now and when my daughter starts to get some visible blackheads she uses it and they disappear.","5"

However, I cant say if this is good for dry and sensitive skin bc I personally have oily skin. My skin doesn't feel irritated and not overly dry. As long as you follow up with your moisturizers you should be fine tbh. smell isn't bad and I recommend use cotton pads for application !!!","5"
